# MSAPP-PAC-Extract

It's time to edit your canvas Power Apps application as YAML code. You need tools to help you extract and compact those MSAPP's with Microsoft's PAC.

Some shared knowledge and resources (also released under the liberal MIT open source licence) laid the groundwork for the contents of this repository.
